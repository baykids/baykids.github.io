                <p>Congratulations!!!
                    <br>
                    Can't believe you're going to be a freshman next week <span><i class="bi bi-emoji-tear"></i></span>
                    <br>
                    Sucks I can't be there to help you move in but I know you've got this <span><i class="bi bi-heart-fill"></i></span>
                    <br>
                    Been thinking of a good move-in gift but I never even asked what your major was lol.
                    <br>
                    If you follow in your dad's footsteps, at some point, I feel you'll need a website. If you go into tech, this could become your
                    portfolio for potential recruiters. If you go into business (#futureceo), this could be useful in establishing your online presence.
                    <br>
                    Either way I hope this will be helpful in the future so I copped the domain for you before some other Rudro Lahiri in the world could <span><i class="bi bi-emoji-grin"></i></span>
                    <br>
                    And of course #1 perk of having me as your sister is that I'll be your frontend consultant FOR FREE for life.
                    Still I've set everything up in a way that you can build and manage this website on your own as long as you've access to GitHub and learn/know HTML/CSS/JS.
                    <br>
                    Geez I swear I didn't mean to bore you with the details I wanted to celebrate you!!

                <p>
                    I'm so excited for you. Your future is SO bright. College is a playground and
                    I hope you see it like that even when things are hard. Grab every opportunity that comes your way and make the most of it. 
                    Even the intimidating ones because at the end of the day, these 4 years are to build your confidence and character.
                    You'll meet all kinds of people so always be open to learning from them. You're such an intelligent, sweet, attentive and caring boy I'm sure they'll love you. 
                    I hope you find your people soon and find the courage to make all your dreams come true. Try new things and see what resonates with your soul.
                    Do more of what makes you happy and feel free. Hope you can look back upon this time fondly and call Santa Barbara your second home. I wish you all the kindness, happiness and success this world has to offer.
                    SB's lucky to have you!
                    <br>
                    You're never alone bro, I'm always a call away. See you at graduation in 2027 for sure <span><i class="bi bi-emoji-wink"></i></span></p>
